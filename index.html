          Dear students and parents,
          Education is not just a process of giving knowledge for a future job but a lifelong process which creates an understanding of moral and ethical values to guide one’s life in a right path. As a parent, you want the best for your child and we are proud to be working with you to ensure that they are given the right knowledge to face the future challenges. Parents, students and the school authorities are a team and we have to complement each other’s efforts.
          Vishwa Jyoti has the mission that we explore the potential of individual students and promote excellence in every walk of life. With its history of well over twenty-six years and ground-breaking strategies into the future, Vishwa Jyoti represents excellence in all aspects of its operation.
          Vishwa Jyoti, we focus on complete development of our students by involving them in both scholastic & co-scholastic activities as suggested by National Curriculum of Nepal Government . I am sure this will help our children to realize, understand & explore their talents. In order to do this, the parents and the school authorities must work together to inculcate certain values in the students. “Sound body has a Sound Mind.” Let us allow our children to develop physically & mentally. Children learn a lot of values when they are involved in Sports & Games. Some of these life skills & values cannot be taught in the classroom or at home. Vishwa Jyoti provides enough opportunities for the children to participate in Sports & games.
          “If a plant is carefully nurtured by a gardener, it will become good, and produce better fruits.” Therefore, children must be given a good training from their earliest childhood. We are here for the same. I am sure that our students of today, tomorrow will carry forward the Motto of Toward Excellence in their hands at Vishwa Jyoti Secondary School.
